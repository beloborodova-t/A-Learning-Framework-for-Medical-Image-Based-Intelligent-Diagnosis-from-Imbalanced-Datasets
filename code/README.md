A study by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/nestle-acne-assessment) was used as a benchmark for the experiment. 
Steps 1, 2, 3 have been implemented using the [source code that has been developed for the collaborative project between Microsoft and Nestle Skin Health](https://github.com/microsoft/nestle-acne-assessment). 
Our modification of Steps 4, 5 is presented in [Steps4,5.ipynb](https://github.com/beloborodova-t/Deep-Oversampling-Technique-for-4-level-Acne-Classification-in-Imbalanced-Data/blob/main/Step4%2C5.ipynb) code.
